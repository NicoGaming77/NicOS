# NicOS
## What is NicOS?
NicOS is a simple x86 command line operating system that I am making for fun and to learn new things. 

## Building
Building the source code is easy, the compiler toolchain is included in the project.
### Linux
To Build the source code on linux, just run `make`.
### Other OS's
No idea you can figure it out yourself.

## Running
To run the OS I recommend using [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), simply run `qemu-system-x86_64 -fda os-image.bin`
